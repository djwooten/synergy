    From "Theory of synergistic effects: Hill-type response surfaces as 'null-interaction' models for mixtures" - Michael Schindler. This model is built to satisfy the Loewe additivity criterion, 

    Schindler assumes each drug has a Hill dose response, and defines a multidimensional Hill equation that satisfies Loewe additivity. Unlike Loewe, Schindler can be defined for combinations whose effect exceeds Emax of either drug (Loewe is limited by Emax of the *weaker* drug).

    Synergy is simply defined as the difference between the observed E and the E predicted by Schindler's multidimensional Hill equation.
